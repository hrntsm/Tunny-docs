## Fish Market

<img width="30%" alt="image" src="/images/docs_v1/gh-components/fish-market.png">

`Fish Market` component arranges the optimization results on the Rhino viewport.

`Fishes` is the input of the optimization results, `Plane` is the plane in which
you want to align the results, `xNum` is the number of results to be aligned
along the x-axis, `Intvl` is the spacing between results in each direction,
`txtH` is the text height of the text to display the results.

If the model mesh was included in the Artfs input during optimization, the
geometry will be displayed in the viewport along with the results.
